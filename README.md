# Hey there!

Here is a quick coding challenge. We tried to make it as simple as possible so we could see how you write code, solve problems and most importantly - how you THINK.

We have a simple API that returns a JSON array. We would like you to fork this repo. Use HTML, CSS and Javascript to read the API and display it in an organized way. In addition, you should add in some sort of sorting mechanic to the front-end. Feel free to use any frameworks you would like to achieve the task. Be creative!

# Server

To run api on your machine just run `npm install` and `npm run dev`. API is reachable via `http://localhost:8000/`.

To get data from API just call `http://localhost:8000/beer`.

Oh! One more thing – you **have** to send `Authorization: VerySecretToken` header to access the data.

# Deployment

Please deploy your finshed application to `heroku`, you can use this button to start:
